I'm a 16-year-old high school student in San Diego researching **human-AI interaction** within **STEM education**. I also take math, CS, and cognitive science (my favorite) courses at UCSD. My interests lie in the use of **intelligent tutoring systems** and pedagogical AI tutors to support advanced problem solving, critical thinking, and end-user programming. I am mentored by [Annapurna Vadaparty](https://apvadaparty.github.io/) and [Qianou Ma](https://qianouma.com/).

I've received grants from [Foundry10](https://www.foundry10.org/) and the [Lift Off Grant](https://www.liftoffgrant.com/) to support my research. I'm also an [Algoverse](https://algoverse.com) AI Research Fellow and studied proof-based calculus and differential equations through the [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com).

Outside research, I founded the [Henry AI Club](https://henryai.org) at Patrick Henry High School, where I've inroduced an intimate cohort of students to fundamental AI concepts and have competed in high school hackathons together. I am the youngest member of [SDx @UCSD](https://sdxucsd.com), UCSD's largest AI builder community that has partnered with Y Combinator, Anthropic, and Perplexity. I am also a district representitve for [SWEAR](https://swearcommittee.wixsite.com/sdusd), where I advocate and speak about depression and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
